# Ruby Debugging

Welcome to the Ruby Debugging repository. The goal of this repository is to get
you familiar with common debugging tools and idioms. At the end of it I hope you
will have a better understanding of Ruby itself.

Each exercise will present new idioms or reinforce existing ones.

Topics covered:

* [pry-byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug)
* ancestors
* singleton_class.ancestors
* methods
* methods.grep
* instance_variables
* instance_methods
* public_methods
* private_methods
* method(:method_name).source_location
* method(:method_name).super_method.source_location
* backtrace
* caller

## Requirements

* Ruby version `2.3` or higher
* `gem install pry-byebug`

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Work your way through each level, for example:
    * `cd 01/`
    * `ruby main.rb`

## Expected Output

Every solved exercise should include the following output.

```
Framework: Ruby
Version: 2.6.2
Workshop: Ruby debugging
```
